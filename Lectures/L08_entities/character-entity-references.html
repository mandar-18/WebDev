	<h1>Working with HTML chatacter entity references</h1>

	<div>
		<p>&quot;This is used for printing quotes on the webpage.&quot;</p>
		<p>We can display a sample html code on our webpage e.g. &lt;h1&gt;This is a h1 heading&lt;&sol;h1&gt;</p>
		<div>
			HTML character entity references also come handy in multiple different ways as well. While entitites such non breaking spaces are very useful to avoid rendering glitches, these can be misused by us sometimes &amp; this&nbsp;should&nbsp;be avoided. While this information comes free, you can always donate from &#x020B9;10 to our non-profit organization.
